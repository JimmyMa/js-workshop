Make the following code log the sequence of numbers 0-4 in two ways; (1) by refactoring the setTimeout call out into its own function (2) and by changing setTimeout's anonymous function argument into a function that runs immediately and returns a function used as setTimeout's first argument
--
var i;
for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  setTimeout(function () {
    console.log(i);
  }, i*1000);
}
