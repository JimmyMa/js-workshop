Every Car can honk, but here every Car has a new instance of the honk function! Try to fix this so that new Cars will share the honk method, utilizing an objects prototype property! 
--
var Car = function Car () {
  this.honk = function () {
    console.log('Honk!');
  };
};                           

//Car.proto..

var bmw = new Car();         
bmw.honk();

var honda = new Car();         
honda.honk();

assert(bmw.honk === honda.honk);
